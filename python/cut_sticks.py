    You are given N sticks, where the length of each stick is a positive integer.
    A cut operation is performed on the sticks such that all of them are reduced
    by the length of the smallest stick.
    Print the number of sticks that are left before each subsequent cut operation.

    Input:
    6
    5 4 4 2 2 8

    First line is N number of sticks
    Next line is the length of each of the sticks

    Output:
    6
    4 
    2
    1
